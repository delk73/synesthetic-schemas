# Document `_skip` examples and contribution notes

- Motivation: The `_skip` convention for examples is implicit; make it discoverable.
- Scope: Update `README.md` and add brief contribution guidance.

## Tasks
- Document `_skip` behavior in the examples section of `README.md`.
- Add a short CONTRIBUTING blurb: prerequisites, scripts, end-to-end test workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Contributors understand how examples are validated and how to name/place them.
