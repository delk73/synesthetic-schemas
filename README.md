# Synesthetic Schemas

Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for Synesthetic asset and component schemas.

This repo provides canonical JSON Schemas, deterministic code generation for Python/TypeScript, and a reproducible development environment via Nix that matches CI.

---

## ✅ Development Workflow

This project uses [Nix](https://nixos.org/) to provide a reproducible environment. 

### 1. First-Time Setup (Run Once)

After cloning the repository, follow these steps to set up the environment.

```bash
# Step 1: Enter the Nix development shell.
# This provides the correct, pinned versions of Python 3.11, Poetry, and Node.js.
nix develop

# Step 2: Install project dependencies.
# This creates a local .venv/ for Python and a node_modules/ for TypeScript.
poetry install
npm install
```

### 2. Daily Workflow

After the initial setup, you will only need these commands for day-to-day development.

```bash
# To generate all code artifacts from the schemas and run validations:
./build.sh

# To run the fast, read-only pre-commit checks that match CI:
./preflight.sh
```

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting: Resetting the Environment

If you ever encounter a persistent or strange environment issue, you can perform a hard reset to return to a clean slate. This is a safe operation that deletes temporary build artifacts and dependencies.

1.  **Exit all shells:** Make sure you are at your normal system prompt (not inside a `nix develop` shell or a `.venv`).
    ```bash
    exit
    ```

2.  **Clean the project directory:** Run this command from the repo root.
    ```bash
    rm -rf .venv/ node_modules/ flake.lock poetry.toml .cache/ meta/output/ python/src/synesthetic_schemas/ typescript/src/ typescript/tmp/
    ```

3.  **Restart the workflow:** After cleaning, simply follow the **First-Time Setup** steps again.

## One-Time Nix Installation

If this is your first time using Nix, you'll need a brief setup.

1.  **Install Nix:** Follow the instructions at [nixos.org/download.html](https://nixos.org/download.html).

2.  **Enable Nix Flakes:** Add the following line to your Nix configuration file (`~/.config/nix/nix.conf` or `/etc/nix/nix.conf`):
    ```
    experimental-features = nix-command flakes
    ```

## Purpose

Canonical JSON Schemas for:

- `synesthetic-asset`
- `shader`
- `tone`
- `haptic`
- `control`
- `modulation`
- `rule-bundle`

Schemas are normalized and versioned here, then used to generate:

- Backend Pydantic v2 models (Python)
- Frontend `.d.ts` types (TypeScript)
- Validation of real examples with round-trip checks

---

## Layout

```
jsonschema/         # Canonical JSON Schemas (normalized, versioned)
examples/           # Example assets; each carries a $schemaRef
python/             # Generated Python models (Pydantic v2)
typescript/         # Generated TypeScript .d.ts
scripts/            # Normalization, validation, lint, bump-version helpers
codegen/            # Codegen entry points and bundler
Makefile            # One-liner tasks and preflight
preflight.sh        # Runs the exact CI checks locally (read-only)
version.json        # Single source of schema version (e.g., 0.7.0)
```

---

## Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  schemas[Canonical Schemas] --> normalize[Normalize]
  version[version.json] --> normalize
  normalize --> bundle[Bundle refs]
  bundle --> codegen_py[Codegen Python]
  bundle --> codegen_ts[Codegen TypeScript]
  codegen_py --> validate[Validate + round-trip]
  codegen_ts --> validate
  validate --> preflight[Preflight OK]
  preflight --> ci[CI runs ./preflight.sh]
```

Both local `./preflight.sh` and CI execute this exact pipeline to eliminate "works on my machine" drift.

---

## Versioning (Single Source)

- `version.json` holds the canonical schema version.
- Normalization uses this version to set `$id`, `x-schema-version`, and to rewrite absolute `$ref`s.
- Bump the version and normalize:

```bash
make bump-version VERSION=0.7.3
# then regenerate and validate
make codegen-py codegen-ts validate
```

---

## Preflight (CI Parity)

- Read-only checks that must pass before merging:

```bash
./preflight.sh
```

Runs: `normalize-check` → `schema-lint` → `codegen-check` → `validate`.

- Convenience (auto-fix normalization drift locally):

```bash
make preflight-fix   # writes normalized schemas, then runs preflight
```

On success, preflight stamps `.cache/last_preflight.txt` with the UTC timestamp.

- Selective skip (useful when only docs changed):

```bash
SKIP_CODEGEN_CHECK=1 ./preflight.sh
```

- CI notes: The GitHub Actions workflow installs via Poetry and uses a paths filter to only run `codegen-check` when schemas/codegen or tooling inputs change.

---

## Make Targets

- `normalize`: rewrite schemas to canonical form using `version.json`.
- `normalize-check`: fail if any file differs from normalized form (read-only).
- `schema-lint`: check duplicate `$id` and shallow `$ref` resolvability.
- `codegen-py`: generate Python Pydantic models from bundled schemas.
- `codegen-ts`: generate TypeScript `.d.ts` using repo-local tooling.
- `codegen-check`: fail if generated code differs from what’s committed.
- `validate`: validate examples with `$schemaRef` and round-trip via Pydantic.
- `preflight`: run the full read-only gate (CI parity).
- `preflight-fix`: write normalization first, then run `preflight`.
- `bump-version VERSION=X.Y.Z`: update `version.json` and normalize.
- `audit`: generate deterministic repo audit at `meta/SSOT_AUDIT.md`.

---

## Status

- ✅ Canonical schemas normalized and versioned
- ✅ Deterministic Python/TypeScript codegen
- ✅ Examples validate and round-trip clean via `$schemaRef`
- ✅ Preflight matches CI and fails fast on drift
