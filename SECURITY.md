# Security Policy

This repository contains public JSON Schemas and generated type artifacts. It is not a
runtime service and ships no executable server code. As such, the security exposure is
low and primarily concerns the integrity of the specifications and build pipeline.

If you believe you've found a security-relevant issue (e.g., supply-chain risk in our
tooling or a schema design that could enable unsafe behavior in consumers), please:

- Open a GitHub issue with clear details and the `security` label; or
- If you prefer private disclosure, open a GitHub Security Advisory (if enabled) or
  share a minimal reproduction privately with the maintainers.

We review reports on a best-effort basis. For urgent matters, please also @mention the
CODEOWNERS.

Note: For security issues in downstream applications that consume these schemas, report
them to those applications' trackers.
