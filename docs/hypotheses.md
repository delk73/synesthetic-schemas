# Synesthetic Hypotheses

Canonical schemas hosted at: https://delk73.github.io/synesthetic-schemas/schema/0.7.3/

## Relationship to Schema Evolution

This document complements [Schema Evolution](schema_evolution.md).  
Where *Schema Evolution* captures **what changed** in the schema corpus (versioned provenance),  
*Hypotheses* capture **what must be tested or falsified** to validate the Synesthetic system itself.  

- **Schema Evolution** = design lineage of the substrate.  
- **Hypotheses** = falsifiable claims about performance, perception, and explainability on top of that substrate.  

Keeping them separate ensures clarity: provenance and validation remain distinct but cross-referenced.

Canonical list of falsifiable hypotheses guiding Synesthetic development.  
Each entry links to the full protocol or measurement doc.  
Statuses track whether the hypothesis is Active, Draft, Falsified, or Superseded.

---

## Hypothesis 1 — Performance Baseline
- **Claim**: Synesthetic runs real-time multimodal output on constrained hardware.  
- **Protocol**: See [perf/hardware_baseline_a.md](../perf/hardware_baseline_a.md).  
- **Criteria**:  
  - End-to-end frame latency <20 ms  
  - Dropped frames <5% over 5 minutes  
  - Sustained power ≤10 W  
- **Status**: Active

---

## Hypothesis 2 — Explanatory Grounding
- **Claim**: Synesthetic provides a shared perceptual substrate that reduces interpretive variance across explainees.  
- **Protocol**: To be defined in Labs 0.7.3 (generate → preview → apply → rate loops).  
- **Criteria**:  
  - Compare explainee interpretations with vs. without Synesthetic substrate  
  - Measure variance in reported understanding of system state/changes  
- **Status**: Draft

---

## Hypothesis 3 — Control Fidelity
- **Claim**: Synesthetic enforces declared control constraints and reflects state bidirectionally across modalities.  
- **Protocol**: Labs integration tests on slider/knob/patch lifecycle (constraint enforcement, preview/apply reflection).  
- **Criteria**:  
  - 100% compliance with declared min/max/step constraints  
  - GUI reflects state changes within ≤1 frame  
  - No divergence between previewed and applied states  
- **Status**: Draft

---

## Hypothesis 4 — Operator Reduction
- **Claim**: Operator-based schemas reduce duplication and instability across modalities compared to modality-specific fields.  
- **Protocol**: To be defined in Labs (prototype operators in shader/tone/haptic, compare against baseline schemas).  
- **Criteria**:  
  - ≥30% reduction in duplicated schema fields across modalities  
  - Provenance + versioning enforced in 100% of operator instances  
  - Instability/residual metadata available for Labs analysis in ≥90% of tested assets  
- **Status**: Draft
