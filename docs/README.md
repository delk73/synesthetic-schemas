# Synesthetic Documentation

This directory contains conceptual and positioning documents for the Synesthetic system.  
It complements the root README (technical workflow) by providing background, use cases, and reflective notes.

## Purpose

The `docs/` tree is where we capture:  
- Conceptual framing (how Synesthetic aligns with broader research).  
- Use cases (controls, perceptual field, topology).  
- Schema evolution and audit trails.
