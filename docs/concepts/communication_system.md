# Communication System Framing

---

## Version Framing

- **0.7.3 — Scaffold**  
  Synesthetic exposes model state through shader uniforms, schema constraints, and patch lifecycle.  
  This is structured *exposure*, not yet full explanation rather a foundation for building an explanatory medium.  

- **1.0 — Explanatory Substrate**  
  Synesthetic becomes a communication system in the strong sense: multimodal operators, cross-modal mappings,  
  and hypothesis-driven validation make explanations perceptually grounded and falsifiable.  

---

## Context

- **Reference**: *Mind the Gap! Bridging Explainable AI and Human Understanding with Luhmann’s Functional Theory of Communication* (arXiv:2302.03460).  
- **XAI Aims** (Watson & Floridi 2021):  
  1. **Audit** (fairness, overlap with fair ML).  
  2. **Validate** (check model reliance on spurious signals).  
  3. **Discover** (generate novel hypotheses via explanations).  
- Current debate pivots between:  
  - **Dogmatists**: better post-hoc math (e.g., SHAP, Shapley axioms) will eventually suffice.  
  - **Skeptics**: post-hoc methods are unreliable, approximations mislead users.

## Synesthetic as Bridge Layer

Synesthetic steps outside this dialectic.  
It is not a post-hoc approximator layered onto a black box, nor a purely intrinsic model design.  
Instead, it supplies a **native explanatory substrate** — shaders, tones, haptics, and controls rendered in schema-bound, multimodal form.  

- **Information** → schema state and asset deltas.  
- **Utterance** → rendered multimodal outputs (visual/audio/haptic).  
- **Understanding** → validated through falsifiable hypotheses and perceptual protocols.  

This turns explanation from a mathematical approximation into a **communicative act** within a social/technical system.

---

## Differentiation

- **Explanatory Surface**: Perceptual substrate replaces post-hoc approximators.  
- **Structural Coupling**: Declarative schemas + patch lifecycle mediate between model outputs and explainees.  
- **Falsifiability**: Hypotheses test whether communication actually reduces variance or enforces constraints.  

---

## Positioning

Synesthetic occupies the **knife point** in the XAI debate:  
- Beyond dogmatist optimism in better post-hoc math.  
- Beyond skeptic dismissal of approximation error.  
- Toward a communicative substrate that makes system state **legible, testable, and shared**.
