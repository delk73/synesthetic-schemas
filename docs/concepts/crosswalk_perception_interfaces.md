# Cross-Walk: Synesthetic & Embodied AI Interfaces

---
Canonical schemas hosted at: https://delk73.github.io/synesthetic-schemas/schema/0.7.3/

## Purpose

This document establishes a **broad crosswalk** between the Synesthetic system and the current state of the art in embodied AI perception and interfaces.
It is not a final positioning statement, but a **map** that will be refined through Labs output and research.

## Scope

* **Unit of Analysis**: Synesthetic as a **schema-first deterministic substrate** for multimodal perception (shader, tone, haptic, control, modulation).
* **Comparative Targets**: Embodied AI perception pipelines, XR interface standards, low-latency rendering runtimes, and haptic/audio toolkits.
* **Exclusions**: End-to-end large language/world models; pure application-layer products.

## Broad Alignment

* **Perception Substrate**

  * *SOTA*: Learned feature extractors, perceptual tokenization ([AToken (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06722), [V-JEPA (2023)](https://ai.meta.com/blog/v-jepa-yann-lecun-ai-model-video-self-supervised-learning/)).
  * *Synesthetic*: Deterministic, schema-bound components (shader, tone, haptic) with rule-bundle orchestration.
  * Related concept: [Tokenized Manifold](tokenized_manifold.md).
  * *Diagnostic*: Keenan & Sokol (2023), *Mind the Gap!* argue that explanations must be treated as **communication systems** rather than bolt-ons to opaque models. Synesthetic collapses this gap by making schemas themselves the communicative substrate.

* **Interface Layer**

  * *SOTA*: XR APIs ([OpenXR (2017)](https://www.khronos.org/openxr/), [WebGPU (2023)](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/)), haptic SDKs, game engine UIs.
  * *Synesthetic*: Declarative UI + schema-driven controls with bidirectional sync.

* **Runtime Footprint**

  * *SOTA*: GPU/TPU-heavy learned models; cloud-first pipelines.
  * *Synesthetic*: Procedural low-latency substrate targeting FPGA/Jetson-class devices — and proven real-time on **12-year-old i5 Inspiron laptops with Intel integrated graphics**, without dropped frames.

* **Cross-Modal Coupling**

  * *SOTA*: Mostly single-modality or loosely coupled.
  * *Synesthetic*: Schema-unified multimodal coupling (visual/audio/haptic).

## Differentiators (Draft)

* **Determinism**: Procedural rendering + schema guarantees.
* **Auditability**: SSOT schemas + versioned patches.
* **Footprint**: Real-time, low-latency, minimal compute (validated on modest laptops).
* **Flexibility**: Configurable through rule-bundles, not retrained weights.
* **Explanatory Surface**: Natively communicative substrate (schema + rule bundle) versus post-hoc explanation.
* Related positioning: [Positioning Synesthetic in the Embodied AI Landscape](positioning_embodied.md).

## Next Steps

* **Labs Mining**: Surface emergent paradigms from Labs outputs (shader/tone/haptic archetypes).
* **Refinement**: Map mined paradigms against this crosswalk to adjust units and comparisons.
* **Corpus**: Build comparative table with 15–30 SOTA references.
* **Positioning**: Derive clear statements situating Synesthetic within embodied AI interfaces.
