# Naming Rationale: Synesthetic

---

## Why Synesthetic?

The project is named **Synesthetic** because it originates from both lived experience and technical ambition:

- **Personal Source:** I have/had synesthesia. For me, the blending of sounds, colors, textures, and forms was never abstract — it was a direct perceptual crossover. What some researchers once described as an “affliction” was in fact a formative lens. Naming the system Synesthetic is not metaphorical branding; it is rooted in lived perception.  

- **Technical Ambition:** The system is a schema-first, multimodal “perception-layer OS” that unifies audio, visual, and haptic domains. Just as synesthesia links senses involuntarily, Synesthetic links modalities intentionally, providing a structured foundation for interaction and creativity.

## Alignment with Goals

- **Cross-modal mapping:** The name signals the ambition to unify sensory domains (GLSL/SDF shaders, Tone.js audio, haptic controllers) under one schema-first architecture.  
- **Human grounding:** Synesthesia demonstrates that cross-modal perception is not only possible but real in human experience. The system operationalizes that reality.  
- **Narrative resonance:** The term carries weight across science, art, and culture. It bridges technical credibility with creative imagination.

## Reclaiming Synesthesia

Historically, synesthesia has been pathologized — treated as a rare disorder or quirk.  
This project takes the opposite stance:

- **Not deficit, amplifier.**  
- **Not affliction, integration.**  
- **Not hidden, transparent.**

By naming the system **Synesthetic**, we assert that cross-modal integration is a strength - a capability to be extended into tools, interfaces, and platforms. The OS is a conscious reclamation: what was once considered marginal is reframed as central.

## Considerations

- **Ambiguity:** In neuroscience, synesthesia refers to an involuntary condition. Synesthetic (the system) differs: it designs mappings intentionally. This distinction should be made clear in outward-facing descriptions.  
- **Searchability:** “Synesthetic” is a common word. To increase uniqueness, the platform may be referred to as *Synesthetic OS* or *Synesthetic Platform* in formal or external contexts.

## Position

Synesthetic is **more than an interaction OS**. It is a:

- **Perception substrate** — schema-first manifolds (visual/audio/haptic/control/modulation) that are explicit, deterministic, and auditable.
- **Live instrument** — real-time cross-modal synthesis you can play, probe, and tune, not just configure.
- **Protocol** — a common tokenized manifold for devices, agents, and runtimes to interoperate without black-box encoders.
- **Runtime** — low-latency, modest-hardware execution (proven on decade-old laptops; scales to Jetson/FPGA).
- **Research & production loop** — patches, ratings, and logs that turn exploration into repeatable systems.

**One-liner:**  
*Synesthetic is a schema-first perception substrate, instrument, and protocol for real-time cross-modal systems — grounded, deterministic, and light enough to run anywhere.*

**Not:** a monolithic app, a cloud LLM, or a world-model/agent stack. It slots beneath them and can feed or be fed by them.

## External-Facing Note

When describing **Synesthetic** publicly:

> Synesthetic is a schema-first, multimodal platform that turns cross-modal perception into an operating system for interaction.
> Inspired by lived synesthesia, it unifies vision, sound, and touch under one structured framework.
> What was once labeled an affliction is reclaimed. A design principle for the future of creativity and embodiment.

> Synesthetic: A multimodal substrate for human-machine interaction, grounded in schema-first design.
