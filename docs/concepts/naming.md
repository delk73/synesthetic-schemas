# Naming Rationale: *Synesthetic*

## Why *Synesthetic*?  

The project is named *Synesthetic* because it originates from both lived experience and technical ambition:  

- **Personal Source:** I have/had synesthesia. This direct perceptual crossover where sounds, colors, textures, and forms bleed into each other is not an abstract metaphor but a real experience that shaped my sense of perception. Naming the system after that reflects its authentic root.  

- **Technical Ambition:** The system is a schema-first, multimodal “perception-layer OS” that blends audio, visual, and haptic domains. Just as synesthesia links senses, the platform links modalities into a unified interface.

## Alignment with Goals  

- **Cross-modal mapping:** The name signals the ambition to unify sensory domains (GLSL/SDF shaders, Tone.js audio, haptic controllers) under one structured system.  
- **Human grounding:** Synesthesia is a reminder that cross-modal experience is part of real human perception, not just an engineering abstraction.  
- **Narrative resonance:** The term is widely recognized in artistic and scientific contexts, bridging technical credibility with creative imagination.

## Considerations  

- **Ambiguity:** In neuroscience, synesthesia describes an involuntary perceptual condition. Synesthetic (the system) differs—it builds *designed* mappings. This distinction should be acknowledged in external-facing descriptions.  
- **Searchability:** “Synesthetic” is a common word. To improve uniqueness, the system may also be referred to as **Synesthetic OS** or **Synesthetic Platform** in contexts requiring clarity.

## Position  

*Synesthetic* is both the most **authentic** and **ambitious** name for the system:  
- Authentic because it stems from lived experience.  
- Ambitious because it signals the intent to operationalize cross-modal perception as an OS for interaction.
