# Anticipatory Fields as Composable Modalities

## Summary
This document formalizes the concept of **anticipatory fields**—feedforward, prediction-based signal layers that can be composed alongside sensory modalities (visual, auditory, haptic) within the **Synesthetic Schema Corpus**.  
An anticipatory field represents *the body’s expectation of change* in the perceptual environment. Composing or modulating this layer alters perception, balance, and motor fluency, even without changing the external stimulus.

## 1 · Origin of Concept
A spontaneous observation: stepping onto a stationary treadmill while expecting it to move produced a *felt anticipatory correction*.  
The body had pre-generated a motor plan assuming belt motion. When that prediction failed, a perceptual jolt occurred—an embodied realization of the **prediction–correction loop**.

This instance demonstrated that **anticipation is a manipulable signal**, distinct from both stimulus and response.

## 2 · Predictive-Processing Basis
Human perception operates through *active inference*:
1. Generate a **forward model** predicting incoming sensory data.
2. Execute action in accordance with that prediction.
3. Update internal state when **prediction error** occurs.

Anticipatory fields encode step (1).  
When composed with sensory fields, they influence the likelihood and timing of prediction error.  
Modulating these signals effectively sculpts the perceptual frame itself.

## 3 · Schema Representation

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `anticipatory_field` | `object` | Container for prediction-based cues bound to a sensory or motor context. |
| `anticipatory_field.phase` | `float` | Lead or lag relative to expected sensory onset (seconds). |
| `anticipatory_field.gain` | `float` | Magnitude of anticipatory modulation (0–1 normalized). |
| `anticipatory_field.modality_map` | `object` | Coupling weights per modality (`vision`, `audio`, `haptic`). |
| `anticipatory_field.operator` | `string` | Transformation applied to expected signal (`advance`, `dampen`, `invert`). |

Future schema revisions may introduce a unified `anticipation` operator type under the `synesthetic-operator` catalog.

## 4 · Practical Implications

### 4.1 · Perceptual Sculpting
Injecting small phase-lead cues (< 100 ms) can bias perceived smoothness, motion, or stability of a surface without changing its static geometry.

### 4.2 · Motor Entrainment
Feedforward fields modulating gait or reach can increase efficiency by reducing reactive correction.

### 4.3 · Affective Coupling
When anticipatory and sensory fields are congruent, users experience heightened agency and fluency; incongruence induces surprise or tension—useful for expressive design.

### 4.4 · Diagnostic Use
Quantifying required anticipatory amplitude for stable motion provides a behavioral index of predictive-control health (e.g., for rehabilitation, adaptive systems).

## 5 · Integration Path
- Extend schema: add `anticipatory_field` to modality descriptors.  
- Generator/critic: include anticipatory phase/gain metadata in provenance blocks.  
- Validator: ensure coherence between anticipatory and sensory temporal parameters.  
- UX layer (SDFK): support real-time blending and modulation via operator graph.

## 6 · Conceptual Note
Anticipation is not an overlay; it is **the medium of prediction** itself.  
By modeling and composing anticipatory fields, **Synesthetic OS** moves beyond reactive feedback toward a **predictive multimodal substrate**—a live negotiation between expectation and sensation.
